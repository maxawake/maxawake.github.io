      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we want to simulate a stream of electrons in the Pierce Diode in one dimension using the electrostatic Vlasov-Poisson Equation. When simulating such a scenario, usually computational plasma physicists use either the fluid discription of plasmas, called Magneto Hydrodynmaics (MHD), or the semi-lagrangian Particle-In-Cell method to simulate the Vlasov equation. However, both approaches have their drawbacks. For example, the MHD theory is based on a few but fundamental assumptions which break down in certain, very interesting, regimes. PIC on the other hand does not have the limits on e.g.resitivity but needs a computationally very intensive amount of particles to generate solutions with a reasonable low amount of noise at a given space-time resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;machine-learning-quintessence-dark-energy-potentials-via-symbolic-regression-and-bayesian-inference&#34;&gt;Machine Learning Quintessence Dark Energy Potentials via Symbolic Regression and Bayesian Inference&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quintessence is a hypothesized scalar field forming a popular model for dark energy, the nonluminous energy density in the Universe responsible for the accelerated expansion of space.&#xA;This field can change in time and henceforth solve difficulties arising in the ΛCDM standard&#xA;model. The dynamics of the field are governed by its self-interaction potential. To infer the&#xA;form of this potential by observational data, we construct a suitable potential using machine&#xA;learning and derive the observable quantities then numerically. Symbolic regression is a form&#xA;of supervised learning, with the aim of finding the most likely symbolic representations of&#xA;mathematical models for a given data set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
