      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we want to simulate a stream of electrons in the Pierce Diode in one dimension using the electrostatic Vlasov-Poisson Equation. When simulating such a scenario, usually computational plasma physicists use either the fluid discription of plasmas, called Magneto Hydrodynmaics (MHD), or the semi-lagrangian Particle-In-Cell method to simulate the Vlasov equation. However, both approaches have their drawbacks. For example, the MHD theory is based on a few but fundamental assumptions which break down in certain, very interesting, regimes. PIC on the other hand does not have the limits on e.g.resitivity but needs a computationally very intensive amount of particles to generate solutions with a reasonable low amount of noise at a given space-time resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
