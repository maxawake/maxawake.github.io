      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, the interest in im-&#xA;proving epidemiological and statistical models has grown in an unprecedented way. It&#xA;is of global interest to make better estimations and predictions of the future, in order&#xA;for politics and society to decide which counter measures might be useful to successfully&#xA;contain the viral spread of a potentially deadly disease. Especially promising for such&#xA;tasks are methods from the area of machine learning. Not only can machine learning&#xA;models handle sparse and noisy data when regressing models to real world data, but the&#xA;statistical framework in which they usually are formulated make them perfect candidates&#xA;for assessing possible underlying dynamics.&#xA;In this project we want to evaluate this strength of machine learning by comparing two&#xA;rather different state-of-the-art models which have already been successfully applied to&#xA;real-world datasets of the COVID-19 pandemic . The models under investigation are the&#xA;BayesFlow network, which involves an Invertible Neural Network (INN), and Gaus-&#xA;sian Process Regression (GPR). Even though Gaussian Processes are, by its nature,&#xA;parametric-free models and BayesFlows are simulation-based parametric models, both&#xA;are formulated in the Bayesian framework of probability theory and statistics. It is this&#xA;feature that make both models appealing for comparison, since both are able to yield&#xA;uncertainty estimations for their respective predictions.&#xA;Following this we will be taking a closer look into the classical compartment simulation&#xA;of infectious diseases, namely the SIR-model and its advancements building upon. It is&#xA;not only important to understand the dynamics of such a system in order to interpret the&#xA;results, but also does the BayesFlow depend on the simulation as training samples&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The popular and well known classical computer game Bomberman is undoubtedly one of the&#xA;best-suited environments to explore the realm of reinforcement learning and to test cutting edge&#xA;machine learning models. Bomberman is certainly not unknown to the community and has al-&#xA;ready been studied in terms of reinforcement learning. Not only does this game consist of a&#xA;massive amount of possible discrete states, but also demands strategic behaviour in competition&#xA;with multiple opponents. This is a difficult task to learn and to solve for a ordinary computer&#xA;and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to this problem. However, recent developments in the&#xA;on going research in reinforcement learning has shown promising results and brought up many&#xA;remarkable strategies. Some of which we want to take a closer look at.&#xA;In this group project report we want to present the elaboration of our investigations to rein-&#xA;forcement learning methods as well as techniques to train a computer to play Bomberman in&#xA;competition with AI agents, trained by other students.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
