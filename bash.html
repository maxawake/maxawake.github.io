    <h1>Actually Useful Bash Tricks</h1>
    <p>This is a collection of useful tricks with the shell. Apart from essential commands like cp or mv the terminal is 
        an extremely versatile, fast and useful tool when working with computers, operating systems or programs. Most of the 
        tricks i gathered apply only for Arch Linux and are somewhat special. With special i mean that i use them once every few month
        and can't remember them anymore. I thought i share my notes with the world.

        # List file tree with size
        ```bash
        tree --du -h /path/to/folder
        ```
        
        # Get first or last lines of file
        ```bash
        head path/to/file
        # or 
        tail path/to/file
        ```
        # Run scripts in background
        ```bash
        ^Z
        bg // put into background
        fg // put into foreground
        
        ```
        # Find Program in PATH
        ```bash
        compgen -c | grep "name"
        ```
        
        # Remove unused dependencies
        ```bash
        pacman -Rsn $(pacman -Qdtq)
        yay -Scc
        ```
        # Find file in path
        ```bash
        find . -name *.jpg
        ```
        or faster 
        ```bash
        updatedb
        locate -b filename
        ```
        # Export PATH variable (in `.bashrc` or `.profile`)
        ```bash
        export PATH=$PATH:/file/path
        ```
        
        # Delete all files of extension
        ```bash
        find . -name "*.jpg" -type f -delete
        find . -name "*name*" -exec rm -rf {} +
        ```
        
        
        # Run script on startup
        
        ```bash
        sudo chmod 777 /home/max/startup.sh
        crontab -e
        @reboot /home/max/startup.sh
        ```
        
        # Compile and execute MPI
        ```bash
        mpicxx main.cpp -o main -lm && mpirun -np 4 ./main              
        ```
        
        # Copy over ssh with intermediate server
        ```bash
        scp -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p userB@serverB" userC@serverC:/path/to/file.txt home/userA/output.txt
        ```
        
        # ssh public key too open error
        
        Typically you want the permissions to be:
        -   `.ssh` directory: `700 (drwx------)`
        -   public key (`.pub` file): `644 (-rw-r--r--)`
        -   private key (`id_rsa`): `600 (-rw-------)`
        -   lastly your home directory should not be writeable by the group or others (at most `755 (drwxr-xr-x)`).
        
        # Add ssh private key
        ```bash
        ssh-add
        ssd-add -l # to list
        ```
        
        # Print all environment variables
        ```bash
        printenv
        ```
        
        # List all linked libraries of program
        ```bash
        ldd path/to/program
        ```
        
        # Download instagram profiel
        ```bash
        pip install instaloader
        instaloader profile profilename
        ```
        # Apply command to a list of anything with xargs
        
        ```bash
        # for example
        find /path -type f -print | xargs rm
        ```
